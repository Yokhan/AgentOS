# Agent OS 0.2.10

- Simplified the Duo right panel so it presents one readable flow instead of a cockpit of internal modes: `Ask both`, `Codex executes`, a compact route line, and collapsed advanced controls.
- Reduced duplicate Duo status chrome by removing the always-visible mode tab row, lower workspace notice, and noisy next-step button cluster.

# Agent OS 0.2.9

- The startup updater now restarts Agent OS after a downloaded update is installed, so the newly installed UI becomes visible immediately instead of leaving the old running process on screen.

# Agent OS 0.2.8

- The right duo panel now exposes the active orchestrator and a direct `use Codex` / `use Codex as orchestrator` path without digging through runtime controls.
- Codex model choices now merge AgentOS fallbacks, the current saved model, Codex ACP capabilities, and the local Codex `models_cache.json`.
- New GPT-5-family models such as `gpt-5.5` are accepted instead of being reset to `auto`.
